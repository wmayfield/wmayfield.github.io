## Project 2: Oscilloscope

This project was completed in fall of my senior year (2025) through school. It consisted of creating an oscilloscope on a VHDL dev board with data acquisition, HDMI display, and trigger mode. I got the data acquisition and display to work perfectly, but had some issues with the way I was doing the trigger method, as it would stall the display incorrectly. I am not really supposed to provide the code as this is a course that still exists and I don't want to just give someone the answers, but I will provide videos of functionality and some snapshots of my code:
