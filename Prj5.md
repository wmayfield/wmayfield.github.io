## Project 5: 8-Bit Computer

I did this project in the fall of my junior year. While I was not exactly recreating the wheel here and was watching youtube tutorials to create my CPU, I learnt a lot about how CPUs work, but more importantly I experienced the importance of power and signal integrity in a circuit as breadboards are not great for this.
